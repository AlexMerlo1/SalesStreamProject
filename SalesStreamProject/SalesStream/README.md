## Application Goal/Purpose

For this project we are trying to create a point of sales sytem with different menu options that can be used to create and complete orders created. We want to build this because it will test many of the concepts that we have learned throught the semester and put them into one big project. This project would be useful for a fast food restuarant such as McDonalds or Burger King to give an easy way to efficiently track of orders placed and be able to process the purchases quickly.
